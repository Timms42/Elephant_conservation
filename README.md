# Conservation decision making
Code for numerical ODE analysis, data analysis, and plots for Timms & Holden (2024), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110463.

"ode_phase_portrait.py" generates Figures 1a and b, the phase portraits.

"conservation_model_analysis.py" generates Figures 2, 3, 4, the optimal investment plots, as well as Figure A.2, the histogram of the investment ratios.

"zambia_webpage_scraper.py" pulls real estate data from Zambia Real Estate, and "zambia_data_analysis.R" uses this to generate Figure A.1.
"tanzania_webpage_scraper" scrapes a website for Tanzanian real estate data.

"landcell_model_derivatives.nb" performs symbolic calculations for stability analysis of the model in Timms & Holden (2023), as well as aiding in the computations in Section A.7.
